Hi Keaton!  Your work has been stored in prime_numbers.py .  I've come up with my own solution in david_prime_solution.py

To get all this going you'll need:
    * Python
    * Visual Studio Code
    *   GitHub extension
    *   Python extension

To pull this project into VSCode, once you have those extensions installed:
    In a new VS Code window, select 'Clone git repository' and enter the URL for this project (https://github.com/dvranizan/keaton_work.git)

1) PRIME NUMBERS
    If you run my david_prime_solution.py , you'll see how I ask to have the prime numbers list formatted into columns.
    I want your code to do the same thing!
